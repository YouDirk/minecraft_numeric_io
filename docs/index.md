This is the official website of the **YouDirk Numeric I/O Minecraft
mod** `youdirk_numeric_io`.  It adds to the game

* **Blocks** which are **outputing decimal (and hexadecimal) numbers**
  to represent the connected binary encoded Redstone Wires

* **Blocks** which you can **input a number (by right clicking on
  it)**.  These will be encoded to binary and outputed to the
  connected Redstone Wires

* **Negative values** (*TwoÂ´s Complement encoding*) are supported

* **Multiplayer support** - also compatible with Minecraft vanilla
  servers
    - For admins - _but vanilla clients cannot connect to modded
      YouDirk Numeric I/O Minecraft servers_

Initial idea
------------

I want to build a [calculator in vanilla Minecraft
(twitch.tv/you_dirk)](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/jN0fzROVchV32A)
using Redstones and it's logic properties.  In conclusion it is an
8-bit ALU *(Arithmetic Logic Unit)* based on an *Intel 8085* ALU
circuit.  It should be possible to build it without using any mod.
But it's not easy to output the result of your calculation in-game and
there is no suitable way to input the operands into the calculator.
For that reason I decided to implement a mod to do that.

Well, so have fun with it :)
