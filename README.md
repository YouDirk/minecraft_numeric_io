YouDirk Numeric I/O Minecraft mod
=================================

This are the source of the `youdirk_numeric_io` [Minecraft
Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge) mod.  It adds
to the game

* **Blocks** which are **outputing decimal (and hexadecimal) numbers**
  to represent connected binary encoded Redstone Wires

* **Blocks** where you can **input a number (right click on it)**
  which will be encoded as binary and outputed to the connected
  Redstone Wires

* **Negative values** (*Two's Complement encoding*) are supported

Initial idea
------------

I want to build a [calculator in vanilla Minecraft
(twitch.tv/you_dirk)](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/jN0fzROVchV32A)
using Redstones and it's logic properties.  In conclusion it is an
8-bit ALU *(Arithmetic Logic Unit)* based on an *Intel 8085* ALU
circuit.  It should be possible to build it without using any mod.
But it's not easy to output the result of your calculation in-game and
there is no suitable way to input the operands into the calculator.
For that reason I decided to implement a mod to do that.
