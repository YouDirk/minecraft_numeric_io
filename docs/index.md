Initial idea
------------

I want to build a [calculator in vanilla
Minecraft](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/jN0fzROVchV32A) using
Redstones and it's logic properties.  In conclusion it is an 8-bit ALU
*(Arithmetic Logic Unit)* based on an *Intel 8085* ALU circuit.  It
should be possible to build it without using any mod.  But it's not
easy to output the result of your calculation in-game and there is no
suitable way to input the operands into the calculator.  For that
reason I decided to implement a mod to do that.

Well, so have fun with it :)
